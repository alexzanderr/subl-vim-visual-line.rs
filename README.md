# Vim Visual Line
a plugin for sublime text 4 made in rust binded with `pyo3` to python that enables the user a vim visual line experience when using `shift+up` and `shift+down`

the main motivation was to
- select to the beginning of the next line when going up
- select to the end of the next line when going down
- select an extra line for both directions
